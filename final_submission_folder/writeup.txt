- We did this assignment in a group of 2
- Team Members are Yuyutsu Saini (2020MT60571) and Ekansh Singh (2020EE10490)
- We used the flan-T5-base model by combining the eLife_train.jsonl and PLOS_train.jsonl files and then fine tuned the complete model on the combined dataset
- We discussed this assignment with Atif Anwer (2020EE10479) and Tanish Gupta (2020CS10397)
- We used the Hugging Face library for the implementation of the model
- We used the Kaggle for the evaluations of the model
- We used HPC for the training of the model 
- It was a time consuming assignment and we learned a lot from this assignment
- We faced a lot of challenges in the implementation of the model which we subsequently overcame :)
- We have also uploaded a requirements.txt file for the installation of the required libraries with specific versions for the implementation of the model in the same folder
- Please refer to that and install them before running the code
