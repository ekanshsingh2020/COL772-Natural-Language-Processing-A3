Cell-fate reprograming is at the heart of development , yet very little is known about the molecular mechanisms promoting or inhibiting reprograming in intact organisms . In the C . elegans germline , reprograming germ cells into somatic cells requires chromatin perturbation . Here , we describe that such reprograming is facilitated by GLP-1/Notch signaling pathway . This is surprising , since this pathway is best known for maintaining undifferentiated germline stem cells/progenitors . Through a combination of genetics , tissue-specific transcriptome analysis , and functional studies of candidate genes , we uncovered a possible explanation for this unexpected role of GLP-1/Notch . We propose that GLP-1/Notch promotes reprograming by activating specific genes , silenced by the Polycomb repressive complex 2 ( PRC2 ) , and identify the conserved histone demethylase UTX-1 as a crucial GLP-1/Notch target facilitating reprograming . These findings have wide implications , ranging from development to diseases associated with abnormal Notch signaling .  Cell-fate decisions are controlled , on the one hand , by intercellular signaling and , on the other hand , by intrinsic mechanisms such as epigenetic chromatin modifications . The Notch signaling pathway is a highly conserved and widespread signaling mechanism ( Artavanis-Tsakonas et al . , 1999; Greenwald and Kovall , 2013 ) , which has been implicated in key cell-fate decisions such as the decision between proliferation and differentiation ( Liu et al . , 2010 ) . Notch signaling has also been implicated in cellular reprograming . Upon inhibition of Notch signaling , the oncogenic genes KLF4 and cMyc become dispensable for the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPSCs ) from mouse and human keratinocytes ( Ichida et al . , 2014 ) . In this setting , Notch inhibits reprograming . Conversely , Notch signaling promotes transdifferentiation of pancreatic acinar cells to ductal cells ( Sawey et al . , 2007 ) , or the conversion of hepatocytes into biliary cells in liver primary malignancy intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma ( ICC ) ( Sekiya and Suzuki , 2012 ) . Notch signaling can also affect reprograming in normal development . In C . elegans , signaling through the GLP-1 and LIN-12 Notch receptors impedes reprograming during embryogenesis and , during larval development , signaling through LIN-12 is required for the conversion of a rectal epithelial cell into a motorneuron ( Jarriault et al . , 2008; Djabrayan et al . , 2012 ) . The role of epigenetic regulators in cell-fate decisions has been studied mostly in pluripotent cells cultured outside of their normal tissue environment ( Meshorer and Misteli , 2006; Spivakov and Fisher , 2007; Lessard and Crabtree , 2010; Orkin and Hochedlinger , 2011 ) . Therefore , the epigenetic regulation of stem cell identity in intact tissues remains poorly understood . Additionally , the impact of external cues , for example signaling from a stem cell niche to the recipient cell’s chromatin remains equally unresolved . By contrast , C . elegans has been used as a model to study reprograming in an intact organism ( Horner et al . , 1998; Fukushige et al . , 1998; Zhu et al . , 1998; Fukushige and Krause , 2005; Ciosk et al . , 2006; Jarriault et al . , 2008; Yuzyuk et al . , 2009; Riddle et al . , 2013 ) . In this model , germ cells can be directly reprogrammed into neurons by depleting specific chromatin modifiers such as LIN-53 ( Rbbp4/7 ) or components of PRC2 , and by concomitant overexpression of the transcription factor CHE-1 , which induces glutamatergic neuronal fate in a process which we refer to as Germ cell Conversion ( GeCo ) ( Tursun et al . , 2011; Patel et al . , 2012 ) . Here , we identify the Notch signaling pathway as a critical player in this reprograming model . This was unanticipated , since signaling through the Notch receptor GLP-1 ( henceforth GLP-1Notch ) from the somatic gonadal niche is known to maintain germline stem cell/progenitor fate ( Kimble and Crittenden , 2007 ) . To understand this novel , reprograming-promoting role of GLP-1Notch , we combined genetics with tissue-specific expression profiling . We identified genes regulated by GLP-1Notch , including genes recently shown to maintain the germline stem/progenitor cells ( Kershner et al . , 2014 ) . Additionally , and unexpectedly , we found that many genes activated by GLP-1Notch signaling were also repressed by the cell fate-stabilizing chromatin regulator PRC2 . We show that GLP-1Notch and PRC2 have an antagonistic effect on germ cell-fate decisions and demonstrate co-regulation of their common target , utx-1 . Importantly , UTX-1 is a histone demethylase known to erase the gene-silencing methylation of histone H3 dependent on PRC2 ( Maures et al . , 2011; Jin et al . , 2011; Vandamme et al . , 2012 ) . Thus , we propose that the GLP-1Notch–dependent induction of UTX-1 facilitates reprograming by alleviating PRC2-mediated repression of alternative cell fates . 
Klebsiella pneumoniae is a respiratory , blood , liver , and bladder pathogen of significant clinical concern . We show that the adaptor protein , SKAP2 , is required for protection against K . pneumoniae ( ATCC 43816 ) pulmonary infections . Skap2-/- mice had 100-fold higher bacterial burden when compared to wild-type and burden was controlled by SKAP2 expression in innate immune cells . Skap2-/- neutrophils and monocytes were present in infected lungs , and the neutrophils degranulated normally in response to K . pneumoniae infection in mice; however , K . pneumoniae-stimulated reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) production in vitro was abolished . K . pneumoniae-induced neutrophil ROS response required the activity of SFKs , Syk , Btk , PLCγ2 , and PKC . The loss of SKAP2 significantly hindered the K . pneumoniae-induced phosphorylation of SFKs , Syk , and Pyk2 implicating SKAP2 as proximal to their activation in pathogen-signaling pathways . In conclusion , SKAP2-dependent signaling in neutrophils is essential for K . pneumoniae-activated ROS production and for promoting bacterial clearance during infection .  Klebsiella pneumoniae is an opportunistic Gram-negative pathogen that can cause a wide range of life-threatening infections , including pneumonia , sepsis and urinary tract infections ( Bengoechea and Sa Pessoa , 2019; Paczosa and Mecsas , 2016; European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control , 2018; Weiner et al . , 2016 ) . K . pneumoniae is a leading cause of hospital-associated infections with one recent study reporting that K . pneumoniae contributes to 7 . 7% of cases from over 4500 hospitals ( Weiner et al . , 2016 ) . The increasing number of severe , and sometimes systemic , K . pneumoniae infections are largely attributed to a rise in antibiotic-resistant strains ( Falagas et al . , 2014; European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control , 2018; Kobayashi et al . , 2016 ) and hypervirulent strains that generate thicker capsules ( Zhang et al . , 2016; Harada et al . , 2019; Lam et al . , 2018 ) . Highlighting the importance of the innate immune response , neutropenic patients are highly susceptible to life-threatening respiratory and bloodstream infections , including those caused by K . pneumoniae ( Zhu et al . , 2018; Micozzi et al . , 2017 ) . K . pneumoniae lung pathogenesis has been extensively investigated in a mouse model using the rodent-adapted ATCC 43816 ( Bengoechea and Sa Pessoa , 2019; Lawlor et al . , 2005; Xiong et al . , 2015; Bachman et al . , 2015; Vornhagen et al . , 2019; Batra et al . , 2012 ) . In murine models of infection , the K . pneumoniae 43816 strain robustly infects lungs eliciting a strong innate immune response through rapid and concurrent recruitment of neutrophils and iMOs to the infected lungs ( Lawlor et al . , 2005; Xiong et al . , 2015; Cai et al . , 2010; Batra et al . , 2012; Sharma et al . , 2014; Ye et al . , 2001 ) . Work using this strain has revealed several genes that protect K . pneumoniae against the host neutrophil response ( Paczosa et al . , 2020; Silver et al . , 2019 ) . Neutrophils are the first responder cell type for fighting against invading pathogens , however , their activation is tightly regulated to prevent severe tissue damage that have been correlated with several autoimmune and inflammatory diseases ( Mócsai , 2013 ) . At the site of infection , neutrophils can bind to pathogens leading to the activation of various killing mechanisms , including phagocytosis , generation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , degranulation , and release of neutrophil extracellular traps ( NETs ) ( Futosi et al . , 2013; Nguyen et al . , 2017; Mócsai , 2013 ) . Although the K . pneumoniae capsule decreases bacterial binding and internalization ( Regueiro et al . , 2006; March et al . , 2013 ) , ROS , degranulation , NETs , and cytokine production have all been implicated in host defense against K . pneumoniae ( Bengoechea and Sa Pessoa , 2019; Chen et al . , 2016; Hirche et al . , 2005; Ivin et al . , 2017; Paczosa et al . , 2020; Papayannopoulos et al . , 2010; Zhao et al . , 2015 ) . The importance of ROS in host protection is highlighted in the setting of Chronic Granulomatous Disease ( CGD ) , a disease characterized by genetic mutations in the NADPH oxidase , where patients are unable to make ROS and are susceptible to Klebsiella infections ( Wolach et al . , 2017; Bortoletto et al . , 2015 ) . Furthermore , mice with defective ROS production ( Cybb-/- ) have a higher bacterial burden than wild-type mice during K . pneumoniae lung infection ( Paczosa et al . , 2020 ) . Receptor-mediated ROS production in neutrophils is driven by signal-transduction pathways that activate components of the NADPH oxidase complex ( Nguyen et al . , 2017; Futosi et al . , 2013 ) . These signaling pathways are tightly regulated to prevent inappropriate activation and subsequent tissue damage ( Futosi et al . , 2013 ) . Work in mice suggests that signaling through integrin , mincle receptors , G-protein couple receptors ( GPCRs ) and toll-like receptors ( TLRs ) are critical for protection against K . pneumoniae infection ( Teng et al . , 2016; Sharma et al . , 2014; Sharma et al . , 2017; Regueiro et al . , 2006; Galvão et al . , 2018; Bengoechea and Sa Pessoa , 2019 ) . In fact , multiple receptors may sense and/or bind to K . pneumoniae triggering ROS production . Prior studies have indicated a critical role for Src Kinase Associated Phosphoprotein-2 , SKAP2 ( SKAP-Hom and SKAP-55R ) downstream of integrin , and GPCRs in neutrophils and macrophages ( Boras et al . , 2017; Alenghat et al . , 2012; Swanson et al . , 2008; Tanaka et al . , 2016; Mócsai et al . , 2002; Togni et al . , 2005 ) . SKAP2 , a cytosolic adaptor protein , is required for integrin-mediated ROS production , adhesion , and migration to sterile inflammatory sites through its interaction with mediators of actin rearrangement ( Alenghat et al . , 2012; Boras et al . , 2017; Shimamura et al . , 2013; Tanaka et al . , 2016 ) . SKAP2 is also a target for inactivation by bacterial virulence factors , suggesting that it plays a key role in host defenses against infections ( Black et al . , 2000; Rolán et al . , 2013 ) . In humans , the Skap2 gene has been identified as a risk locus for Type 1 Diabetes , and Crohn’s disease ( Jostins et al . , 2012; Barrett et al . , 2009 ) . In resting cells , SKAP2 is thought to exist in an autoinhibitory conformation as a homodimer that is constitutively bound to PRAM-1 in neutrophils ( Moog-Lutz et al . , 2001; Rolán et al . , 2013 ) , or its homolog , ADAP , in other immune cells ( Liu et al . , 1998; Marie-Cardine et al . , 1998; Black et al . , 2000; Ophir et al . , 2013 ) . Upon receptor activation , SKAP2 changes to an active conformation that is localized to the plasma membrane , which allows it to interact other effector proteins including Src Family Kinases ( SFKs ) ( Bureau et al . , 2018; Marie-Cardine et al . , 1998; Liu et al . , 1998 ) . In addition , activated SKAP proteins can relay information from receptors to focal adhesion kinases ( FAK1/Pyk2 ) to other cytoskeletal mediators ( Ménasché et al . , 2007; Boras et al . , 2017; Tanaka et al . , 2016; Raab et al . , 2017; Ophir et al . , 2013 ) . Using a murine model of K . pneumoniae 43816 infection , we characterized the role of SKAP2 in pulmonary host defense against K . pneumoniae in this study . We demonstrate that SKAP2-expressing neutrophils contributed to the pulmonary containment of K . pneumoniae in lungs independent of inflammatory monocytes . Using murine neutrophils , we show that K . pneumoniae-induced ROS production requires SKAP2 , SFKs , Syk , PLCγ , Btk , and PKC , and that SKAP2 is required for maximal K . pneumoniae-activated phosphorylation of the tyrosine kinases SFKs , Syk , and Pyk2 . 
Plasmodium vivax relapse infections occur following activation of latent liver-stages parasites ( hypnozoites ) causing new blood-stage infections weeks to months after the initial infection . We develop a within-host mathematical model of liver-stage hypnozoites , and validate it against data from tropical strains of P . vivax . The within-host model is embedded in a P . vivax transmission model to demonstrate the build-up of the hypnozoite reservoir following new infections and its depletion through hypnozoite activation and death . The hypnozoite reservoir is predicted to be over-dispersed with many individuals having few or no hypnozoites , and some having intensely infected livers . Individuals with more hypnozoites are predicted to experience more relapses and contribute more to onwards P . vivax transmission . Incorporating hypnozoite killing drugs such as primaquine into first-line treatment regimens is predicted to cause substantial reductions in P . vivax transmission as individuals with the most hypnozoites are more likely to relapse and be targeted for treatment .  The study of the transmission dynamics of vector-borne diseases such as Plasmodium falciparum malaria has a rich history , with a theoretical foundation based on the Ross-Macdonald models ( malERA Consultative Group on Modeling , 2011; Smith et al . , 2012; Reiner et al . , 2013; Smith et al . , 2014 ) , a class of mathematical models describing the transmission of a pathogen between human and vector hosts . In the case of P . falciparum , the parasite has a reservoir in both the human host and the Anopheles mosquito , with transmission occurring when a mosquito takes a blood meal from a human . Ross-Macdonald models have provided insights into the dynamics of P . falciparum transmission resulting in valuable guidance for historical and contemporary malaria control programmes , most notably the large reductions in transmission that are achievable if the lifespan of the mosquito is reduced through vector control ( Macdonald , 1952a; Macdonald , 1952b ) . In contrast to the extensive theory of the mathematical epidemiology of P . falciparum malaria ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) , P . vivax malaria has been comparatively neglected . This is in spite of P . vivax being the geographically most widely distributed species of malaria in the world , causing in the region of 80–300 million clinical episodes every year ( Mueller et al . , 2009a; Gething et al . , 2012 ) . P . falciparum models are not applicable to P . vivax as they fail to account for the reservoir of dormant liver stages ( hypnozoites ) which give rise to relapsing infections—one of the defining characteristics of the biology and epidemiology of P . vivax ( Mueller et al . , 2009a ) . In natural transmission settings relapses are often undistinguishable from re-infections from new mosquito bites or recrudescences of existing blood-stage infections . When the origin of renewed parasitemia following primary P . vivax infection is unknown , it can be classified as a recurrent infection ( Battle et al . , 2014 ) . Most existing models of malaria transmission do not account for the additional reservoir of parasites in the liver , but the hypnozoite reservoir has been incorporated into some P . vivax transmission models as a state to denote hypnozoite infection ( Ishikawa et al . , 2003; Chamchod and Beier , 2013; Roy et al . , 2013 ) or as up to two broods of hypnozoites ( Dezoysa et al . , 1991 ) . Relapse patterns and their implications for transmission have also been investigated using statistical distributions for the time to first relapse ( Lover et al . , 2014 ) . Here we advance on existing work by considering how the number of hypnozoites in the liver contributes to patterns of relapse infections and the epidemiology and control of P . vivax . When a P . vivax infected mosquito takes a blood meal from a human , sporozoites are injected into the skin and migrate to the liver , where they invade hepatocytes and develop into either actively dividing schizonts or dormant hypnozoites . The development of actively dividing schizonts may lead to a primary blood-stage infection and potentially clinical malaria ( Mueller et al . , 2013 ) . Hypnozoites will lie dormant in the liver for weeks to years before activating to initiate new blood-stage infections . The biological mechanisms regulating the activation of hypnozoites remain unknown ( Mueller et al . , 2009a ) , although a number of triggers for relapses have been proposed , including fever caused by other pathogens such as P . falciparum ( Shanks and White , 2013 ) and exposure to Anopheles-specific proteins ( Hulden and Hulden , 2011 ) . There is considerable geographical variation in the timing and frequency of P . vivax relapse infections , with strains from tropical areas having an average time to first relapse of 3–6 weeks and long-latency strains from temperate areas relapsing within 6–9 months ( Lover and Coker , 2013; Battle et al . , 2014 ) . Beyond the first relapse , periodic patterns in multiple relapses from a single mosquito bite have been observed ( White , 2011 ) . For example , following a single infection with a tropical strain of P . vivax the time until next relapse has been observed to increase with each successive relapse ( Berliner et al . , 1948; White , 2011 ) . In contrast , temperate strains are associated with a long latency period until first relapse ( of the order of 6 months ) followed by short intervals between successive relapses ( Coatney et al . , 1950; Hankey et al . , 1953; White , 2011 ) . A descriptive epidemiology of P . vivax relapses will thus require estimation of three key quantities: ( i ) the time to first relapse , ( ii ) the number of relapses per primary infection , and ( iii ) the duration of hypnozoite carriage . In this manuscript , a within-host model of hypnozoites in liver hepatocytes is developed to demonstrate that many of the epidemiological patterns of relapse infections can be explained by making the assumption that hypnozoites activate and die at a constant rate . This model is integrated into the existing theory of Ross-Macdonald models to account for the relapse infections characteristic of P . vivax malaria . We use this model to provide qualitative insights into the relative contribution of relapses to P . vivax transmission and illustrate the consequences for controlling P . vivax with vector control and anti-malarial drugs .
